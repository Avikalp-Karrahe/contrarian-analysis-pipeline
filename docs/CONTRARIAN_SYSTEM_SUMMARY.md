# Contrarian Earnings Analysis System - Complete Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive **Contrarian Earnings Analysis System** that identifies analysts and authors who were minority voices before earnings announcements but were proven right by actual results. This system addresses your end goal of finding contrarian voices in financial journalism.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Main Analyzer** (`contrarian_earnings_analyzer.py`)
   - Collects pre-earnings articles using Guardian API
   - Analyzes sentiment and predictions using Groq LLM
   - Retrieves actual earnings results via Yahoo Finance
   - Identifies and scores contrarian voices

2. **Command-Line Interface** (`run_contrarian_analysis.py`)
   - User-friendly CLI for running analyses
   - Flexible parameter configuration
   - Comprehensive error handling and validation

3. **Demo System** (`contrarian_demo.py`)
   - Working demonstration with mock data
   - Shows complete contrarian identification process
   - Educational tool for understanding the methodology

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Article Collection**
   - Searches Guardian API for company articles before earnings date
   - Filters by date range (configurable days before earnings)
   - Extracts headline, body, author, and publication details

2. **AI-Powered Analysis**
   - Uses Groq's Llama3 model to analyze each article
   - Extracts sentiment (bullish/bearish/neutral)
   - Identifies earnings predictions (beat/miss/meet)
   - Assesses confidence levels and reasoning

3. **Actual Results Comparison**
   - Retrieves earnings data using Yahoo Finance
   - Calculates stock price movement around earnings
   - Classifies actual result (beat/miss/meet)

4. **Contrarian Identification**
   - Identifies minority voices (<30% consensus)
   - Checks prediction accuracy against actual results
   - Calculates contrarian scores based on minority status and correctness

### Contrarian Scoring Algorithm

```
Contrarian Score = (1 - minority_percentage) Ã— 100

Where:
- minority_percentage = proportion of analysts with same view
- Higher scores indicate smaller minorities who were correct
```

## Demo Results

The demo system successfully demonstrates the concept:

**Scenario**: Apple Q2 2024 Earnings
- **Majority Sentiment**: Bearish (62.5% of analysts)
- **Majority Prediction**: Miss (62.5% expected earnings miss)
- **Actual Result**: Beat (+7.2% stock price increase)
- **Contrarians Identified**: 2 bullish analysts who predicted beat

**Top Contrarian**: Michael Chen
- **Contrarian Score**: 75/100
- **Reasoning**: Predicted strong services revenue despite market pessimism
- **Accuracy**: Correctly predicted both bullish sentiment and earnings beat

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Source Data Integration
- **News Articles**: Guardian API for comprehensive article collection
- **AI Analysis**: Groq LLM for sophisticated sentiment analysis
- **Financial Data**: Yahoo Finance for actual earnings results

### 2. Intelligent Analysis
- **Sentiment Classification**: Bullish, bearish, neutral with confidence levels
- **Prediction Extraction**: Specific earnings forecasts (beat/miss/meet)
- **Reasoning Capture**: Key concerns and rationale from each article

### 3. Contrarian Detection
- **Minority Identification**: Finds voices with <30% consensus
- **Accuracy Verification**: Compares predictions with actual results
- **Scoring System**: Quantifies contrarian value (0-100 scale)

### 4. Comprehensive Reporting
- **JSON Reports**: Detailed analysis with all data points
- **Console Output**: User-friendly summary of findings
- **Historical Tracking**: Saves reports for future reference

## Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis
```bash
python run_contrarian_analysis.py \
    --company "Apple" \
    --symbol "AAPL" \
    --earnings-date "2024-05-02"
```

### Advanced Configuration
```bash
python run_contrarian_analysis.py \
    --company "Tesla" \
    --symbol "TSLA" \
    --earnings-date "2024-04-23" \
    --days-before 45 \
    --output "tesla_contrarian_report.json" \
    --verbose
```

### Demo Mode
```bash
python contrarian_demo.py
```

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
- **yfinance**: Stock and earnings data retrieval
- **groq**: LLM API for sentiment analysis
- **requests**: API communication
- **pandas**: Data manipulation
- **python-dotenv**: Environment configuration

### API Requirements
- **Guardian API Key**: For news article collection
- **Groq API Key**: For AI-powered analysis

### Configuration
API keys stored in `.env` file:
```env
GUARDIAN_API_KEY=your_key_here
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

- **API Sharing**: Uses same Guardian API key as existing system

## Conclusion

The Contrarian Earnings Analysis System successfully addresses your goal of identifying contrarian voices in financial journalism. The system:
