## 🔬 Research Project Overview

### 📊 Research Question
**"Can systematic identification and tracking of contrarian financial analysts provide superior investment signals compared to following market consensus?"**

### 🎯 Research Objectives

1. **Identify Contrarian Patterns**: Systematically detect analysts who consistently oppose market sentiment during earnings announcements
2. **Quantify Performance**: Measure the historical accuracy and profitability of contrarian analyst recommendations
3. **Develop Predictive Models**: Create algorithms that can predict when contrarian signals are most likely to be accurate
4. **Generate Investment Alpha**: Transform contrarian insights into actionable investment strategies

### 🔄 Research Methodology Flow

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **Data Ingestion**: Collect earnings reports, analyst recommendations, and market data
2. **Sentiment Classification**: Apply NLP to categorize analyst sentiment (bullish/bearish/neutral)
3. **Consensus Calculation**: Determine market consensus for each earnings announcement
4. **Contrarian Identification**: Flag analysts whose recommendations oppose consensus
5. **Historical Analysis**: Track performance of contrarian calls over time
6. **Pattern Mining**: Identify conditions when contrarian signals are most accurate
7. **Signal Scoring**: Develop confidence scores for contrarian recommendations
8. **Portfolio Construction**: Generate investment strategies based on high-confidence signals

### 📈 Expected Research Outcomes

#### **Primary Hypotheses to Test:**
- **H1**: Contrarian analysts outperform consensus during market overreactions
